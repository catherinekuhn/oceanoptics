When working with the Sunphotometer data, plot the natural log of the signal (at some wavelength) vs airmass.Airmass  = 1/cos(solarzenith angle, SZA in data file).Signal is in the columns listed as Sig…The wavelengths we have are:On the ozone sunphotometer:SIG305, SIG312, SIG320, SIG936, SIG1020On the aerosol sunphotometer there is: SIG380, SIG440, SIG500, SIG675, SIG870The slope should be the total optical depth….if you had a good data set, the intercept would be the calibration coefficient for the system.
