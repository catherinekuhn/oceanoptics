	Description:  
		Abstract:  IMPOUNDS contains point locations of dams, levees, and impoundments in Maine at 1:24000 scale. Original data were from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) 1987 Dam Survey.  Additional points were added by Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP), Bureau of Land & Water Quality (BL&WQ) staff for use with BL&WQ projects. In 2004, MEDEP made the data available for use by the Maine Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) . For MEMA, all point locations were reviewed, against existing orthophotography or digital raster graphic base layers. Feature metadata (FM) items were added to the IMPOUNDS attribute set. Points were compiled to the raster base layer. References for the update were added the FM fields.
		Purpose:  IMPOUNDS was designed for display and  reference only.

	Use_Constraints:  Users must assume responsibility in determining the usability of this data for their purposes. Digital maps retain the accuracy of their source materials. The best use of data mapped at scales of 1:500,000 and 1:250,000 is in statewide planning and studies; at 1:100,000 in regional planning and studies; at 1:62,500 and 1:24,000 in detailed studies and local planning; and at 1:12,000 and 1:5,000 or larger scales in parcel level studies and detailed local planning. In the use of Maine GIS data, please check sources, scale, accuracy, currentness and other available information. Please confirm that you are using the correct copy of both data and metadata from the Maine GIS Data Catalog. Updates, corrections, and feedback, incorporated in the Maine GIS database are made in accordance with "Data Standards for Maine Geographic Information Systems", 2002 and coordinated by MEGIS

The NID was reauthorized in Section 215 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-303). The NID includes dams that are at least 25 feet high, or impound at least 50 acre-feet of water at maximum pool level (as defined in law). The NID is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in cooperation with the Association of State Dam Safety Officials (ASDSO), the states and territories, and dam owning Federal Agencies. Information on dams in the United States can be accessed through the National Inventory of Dams website .

	Overview_Description:  
		Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:  IMPOUNDS is attributed with the MEDEP water resource regulation ID and the USACE national COE ID number. Other attributes from MEDEP and USACE include information on height, length, construction type, completion year, reservoir storage, purpose, regulatory authority, ownership, ownership type, river impounded, as well as proximity and hazard to nearby locations.
		Entity_and_Attribute_Detail_Citation:  The  ArcView shapefile and ArcGIS geodatabase formats, commonly used for Maine GIS data, carry default identifiers and attributes that are software generated and/or important for internal recordkeeping. These are listed here to avoid repetition for every layer, and may not be repeated in the attribute descriptions and definitions of each layer. Common software generated identifiers and attributes in Maine GIS data include: FID (feature identifier), Shape (feature geometry), OBJECTID and SHAPE_lengt.  In addition, most GIS formats will carry fields for PERIMETER, AREA and/or LENGTH according to feature geometry. These fields are typically available by default, with the units based on coordinate system or projection units of GIS data. Most GIS software packages also provide a means to calculate these values. It is important to test any columns containing PERIMETER, AREA or LENGTH values before using them for analysis purposes. These important values can be carried from format to format and become out-dated. Verify that the values are correct. Also, in your GIS software, please view the properties of data layers for the map units used to calculate these fields, and for the units set for display purposes.

				Format_Information_Content:  MEGIS has made all vector layers, in the Maine GIS Internet Data Catalog, available in ESRI's ArcView shapefile format. A shapefile is a simple non-topological format that stores the geometry and attribute information for a set of geographic features as a set of vector (point, line, polygon) coordinates. Shapefiles draw quickly and directly in ArcView, ArcGIS, ArcExplorer. Shapefiles are a compatible data type for many other types of GIS software. Three files are fundamental to each shapefile: .shp stores the feature geometry (shape and location information); .shx stores the index of the feature geometry; .dbf a dBASE (TM) file stores the attribute information for the features. Other index files may be created to help speed analysis and query: these file formats are .sbn  .sbx  .ain .aix .fbn and .fbx. In addition you may find projection .prj, and metadata .xml, files associated with shapefiles.
